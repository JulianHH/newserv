Syntax:  checkchannel [channel] ["summary"]
Example: checkchannel #chan
Lists some information on a channel.
The information currently consists of the channel creation time and a list of users on the channel.
As a security restriction, channels with opers on them or channels that are +k can not be checked using this command.
If the summary parameter is given then the list of users for the channel is suppressed.
